# The-Apple
IMD final

	So, my basic project is that I have a leader and 5 followers that are all aiming for the food. There is a monster that lives near the food. He wonders around the area and attacks those that come to close him.
	There are several fun things with this project. You follow the leader and see through his eyes. There is some basic wall avoidance going on. The humans flee the monster if the monster comes too close and the monster attacks them if they come to close. The monster doesnâ€™t try and leave his area, but he might if the leader provokes him too much. If the leader gets him, he dies and a new leader spawns at the beginning. Also, if the leader gets the apple, then the apple respawns in a random spot around the monster. Then, we get to the advanced behaviors.
	There are two advanced behaviors in this project. The first is arrival. The leader arrives at the apple. He slows down until he stops at the apple. The second is leader following. The followers seek the position behind the leader, but flee the position in front of the leader. Finally they are forced to separate.
